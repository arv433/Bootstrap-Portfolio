                            <p> I aspire to learn as many skills as I can in software development, followed by business administration
                                in my near future. My personal goal is to contribute to the future of computer functionality
                                and algorithms by applying the concepts I’ve cultivated overtime.
                            </p>
                            <p> Although a day in my life really varies, you’ll usually find me hard at work studying Swift,
                                Python, or JavaScript among other languages and libraries so that I can one day dedicate
                                all of my time to achieving my goals and passions becoming a professional software developer.
                            </p>
                            <p> In five years I see myself living in a small apartment in San Fransisco right next to my chosen
                                office, waking up early in the morning each day of the week to work on any exciting new project
                                that I’ll have invested myself into at the time. My biggest desire is a lifestyle revolved
                                around deep working ethics and focus.
                            </p>
